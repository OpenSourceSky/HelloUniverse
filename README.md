HelloUniverse
=============

A little graphical interface to help people explore the sky.

Allows you to take a picture of the night sky, identify the stars and other objects in the image,
and plot the locations of objects you might want to find and photograph.  ("Mars is 30 degrees that way!")

Uses Qt for the user interface, Astrometry.net for identifying pictures of the sky, and gphoto for
talking to cameras.

Very preliminary.
